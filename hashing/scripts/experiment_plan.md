# Experiment Plan

## Fig 1: Varying input arrival rate 
Line graph

case 0~4

X-axis: 1 10 100 1000 infinite

Required data: test case varying step size.

## Fig 2: Varying input arrival distribution
Line graph

X-axis: 0 0.2 0.4 0.8 1

Required data: test zipf distribution timestamp.

## Fig 3: Varying key-field distribution
Line graph

Based on uniform time distribution

X-axis: 0 0.2 0.4 0.8 1

Required data: test varying key distribution.

## Fig 4: Varying window size
Line graph

Based on uniform time distribution

X-axis: 0 0.2 0.4 0.8 1

Required data: test varying key distribution.




















Histogram graph

X-axis: unique, zipf(0), zipf(0.2)...

Y-axis: N/ last row of timestamp * different algorithms

Required data: test case 0 ~ 5 of all algorithms.
